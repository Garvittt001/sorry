    <h2>My Apology</h2>
    <p>
      Dear Shubhaamvii,<br><br>
      I know I’ve caused you pain, and I truly regret my actions. I never intended to hurt you, and I am deeply sorry for what I've done. Our Freindship means the world to me, and I would never want to hurt you intentionally.<br><br>
      I’m not perfect, but I promise to learn from my mistakes and never repeat them. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You deserve all the happiness, and I will do everything I can to make things right.<br><br>
      With sincere apologies,<br>
      Garvittt
